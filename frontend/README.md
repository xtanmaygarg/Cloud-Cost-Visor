# Cloud Cost Visor (Frontend)

## Problem Statement
- Cloud resource management can be tricky and can easily grow out of hand
as we have more and more resources.
- Even though we have billing dashboards provided by the cloud vendors they
fall sort from providing granular control over resources cost.
- Less customizable alert for alerts or actions.
- Less granular IAM control over who can view what pricing data.

## Solution Strategy
- Build a cloud cost analysis dashboard by utilizing exported billing data.
- Show granular cost analysis for individual resources along with their cost
trends.
- Have proper IAM access for better permissions on who can view what pricing
data.
- Provide custom alert and action for better resource management and lower
overall monthly invoice.
